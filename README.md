Hot Air (Node.js project)
==========================

An implementation of Hot Air using Node.js / CouchDB.

Release Notes
-------------


### 0.1.6 
- Added additional logging for couchdb

### 0.1: Private beta

 - Major display bugs fixed
 - Game is playable
 - High scores are recorded
 - Basic analytics in place
 - Full gameplay cycle is operational

 
Build
-----
 
Eventually we should set up a grunt build system for pre-deployment.
 
A brief outline of what this would (ideally) include -- items with (*) are higher-priority:
 
 - Minify js and concatenate into a single file *
 - Minify css
 - Export PSD project files as .PNG images, then combine into sprite sheet(s) *
 - Automatically export sprites.js during sprite sheet creation
 - Upload static files to a CDN
 - Generate documentation using yuidoc

### Sprite build process overview ###

#### PSD Files

The PSD files should be organized in a logical structure, so that related sprites can be grouped together. A basic structure would be:
	
	imgsrc/
	  |
	  +- master_sprite/
	      |
	      +- simple_sprite_componant.psd
	      +- complex_sprite_component/
	      |    |
	      |    +- complex_sprite_component1.psd
	      |    +- complex_sprite_component2.psd
	      |    +- complex_sprite_component3.psd
	      |
	      +- another_simple_sprite_component.psd
	      :
	      
	      [etc..]
	        
	
#### PSD Export

When processed, the PSD directory tree will be mapped to the build folder, probably in build/sprite-frames or something similar.

In this structure the only difference is that each PSD is replace by a folder of consecutively number PNG frames of the same name (i.e. balloon.psd --> balloon/)

	imgsrc/
	  |
	  +- master_sprite/
	      |
	      +- simple_sprite_componant/
	      |    |
	      |    +- simple_sprite_componant_0001.png
	      |    +- simple_sprite_componant_0002.png
	      |    +- simple_sprite_componant_0003.png
	      |    :
	      |    [etc..]
	      |
	      +- complex_sprite_component/
	      |    |
	      |    +- complex_sprite_component1/
	      |    |    |
	      |    |    +- complex_sprite_component1_0001.png
	      |    |    +- complex_sprite_component1_0002.png
	      |    |    +- complex_sprite_component1_0003.png
	      |    |    :
	      |    |    [etc..]	
	      |    |
	      :    : 
	      
	      [etc..]
	        
#### Sprite Mapping

Once the frames are all created, they will need to be combined into a spritesheet that can be used by Crafty.js. Right now the best approach to this seems to be modifying the node-spritesheet package (https://github.com/richardbutler/node-spritesheet).


#### Export Settings

To avoid confusion when sprites are added/removed, or if they are resized, ideally the image build would also export a Crafy.sprite definition that would fill in the necessary values. It may be necessary to modify the Crafty sprite component so that it is able to better manage different sprite sizes/locations in one sheet (will need to investigate this).

#### Current Commonds

This will only work on OX X, and it's still a quite shaky. It will create a directory called `frames` in the same directory as the psd file. The "frames" argument refers to the jsx script to execute (currently "frames" is the only one). _This example executes from the project root_

	osascript script/scpt/jsx.scpt frames [path-to-psd]

The following will output a png and css to the current dir ([sprite-frames-dir].png, [sprite-frames-dir].css). _This example executes from the PSDs diretory._

	glue --ignore-filename-paddings --algorithm=horizontal [sprite-frames-dir] ./
	
Requires glue, a python library for creating sprites: 
 - On github: https://github.com/jorgebastida/glue
 - Installation: http://glue.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#osx
 - Installing Python/pip on OS X: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/#install-osx
	

Documentation
-------------

The js docs are generated using YUIDoc.  First, install the yuidocjs npm package. Then, to generate the js docs for the modules, navigate to the public/js/modules directory and run:

> yuidoc .

The yuidoc.json config file is tracked in that folder, and contains a few settings that can be updated as needed.
